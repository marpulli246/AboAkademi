Learning objectives and transferable skills

At the end of this course, the students will be able to:

identify the characteristics of datasets and compare the trivial data and big data for various applications. select and implement machine learning techniques and computing environment that are suitable for the applications under consideration. understand and apply machine learning techniques and associated computing techniques and technologies recognise and implement various ways of selecting suitable model parameters for different machine learning techniques.

Machine learning skills are fast becoming necessary for data scientists as companies navigate the data and try to build automated decision systems that hinge on predictive accuracy. Machine learning techniques enable us to automatically extract features from data so as to solve predictive tasks, such as speech recognition, object recognition, machine translation, question-answering, anomaly detection, medical diagnosis and prognosis, automatic algorithm configuration, personalisation, robot control, time series forecasting, and much more. Learning systems adapt so that they can solve new tasks, related to previously encountered tasks, more efficiently. This course will introduce the field of Machine Learning, in particular focusing on the core concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning. Students will learn the algorithms which underpin many popular Machine Learning techniques, as well as developing an understanding of the theoretical relationships between these algorithms. The practicals will concern the application of machine learning to a range of real-world problems.
